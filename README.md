# Dell-fan-control-config-system-service
 This repo combines the use of fancontrol,i8kutils and dell-fan-control modules to create a startup service for dell laptops whose processor fan doesnt work on linux
# DISCLAIMER
 Causes Bootloop in Some Distro's(Try Only if you have a live Linux USB)
 I switched to Debian 12.6 which fixed fan control issue's and can't test the service
